# overworld ![Build status badge](https://github.com/riknoll/overworld/workflows/MakeCode/badge.svg)

This extension contains advanced APIs for working with tilemaps in blocks. The APIS are
divided into two categories:

1. **Tilemap** - Blocks that can be used with any tilemap in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade
1. **Overworld** - Blocks that can be used to create multiple tilemaps and transition between them

Overworld is great for creating worlds in MakeCode Arcade composed of multiple
tilemaps. Here are some good use cases:

1. Games with multiple levels
1. Games with multiple settings linked by doorways
1. Games with locations connected by an overworld
1. Top-down games where the player moves between multiple connected "screens"
1. Procedurally generated tilemap games
